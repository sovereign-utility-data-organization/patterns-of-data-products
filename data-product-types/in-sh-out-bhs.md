# 12.10 — stream + human → file/stream + human

**Interface:** IN {S, H} → OUT {B, S, H}&emsp;&emsp;**Verdict:** common

A product that takes live streams and human-produced data and serves bulk files, a live feed, and a human-facing surface (dashboard/report). People both produce and read the data: the human pattern is on both sides.

## When to use

A small group of people both maintains and reads the data, with no machine consumer — a shared, human-scale record rather than an automated interface.

## What's inside

- Ingest: a **stream consumer** (offsets, replay) for the live leg and **human entry / curation** — data produced by people (forms, editors, review UIs), validated and audit-trailed on every change.
- Core: a **fold/aggregation core** that folds the live leg into queryable state or windowed files
- Serve: a **publication job** that materialises bulk artifacts (files/bundles) with a manifest and as-of, a **producer** re-exposing the (transformed) live feed, and a **human-facing surface** (dashboard, report, printout, or review screen) — the layer people actually read.
- State: a durable **state store**, the **feed log** (retention), the **retained bulk artifacts**, and an **audit trail** of human changes.

## State & cost

Dominated by the durable state store (grows with entity/state breadth), the input and output feed logs, the retained bulk artifacts, and the audit trail of human edits.

## Watch out

- **Softness is a cost, not a value judgement.** Human-entered data is the softest input — irregular, subjective, error-prone, expensive to re-issue — so it needs **validation, provenance, and a correction path**, and trust leans on the audit trail, not the schedule. It is also the most expensive channel: where a machine source *can* carry the same meaning, prefer it, and keep the human leg for what only a person can supply.
- **Human input can be the value-driver.** Where the human act *is* the value — a judgement, a design intent, creative or social content, an accountable decision — and cannot be automated, human input is the **most valuable input** the product has, and the other legs exist to *enrich* it (see [the role of human input](/knowledge-concepts/role-of-human-input)).
- A human-facing surface inherits the state behind it: the report/dashboard carries every as-of and correctness rule of the store, and a person spots a stale number faster than an API client will.
- Late and out-of-order events are a **first-class** question: a watermark and a re-issue/correction rule, or history gains holes and duplicate facts.

## Typical next step

add a **query API** → cell [12.8](/data-product-types/in-sh-out-brsh); or the source world gains a leg this product does not yet take, and it migrates to a richer IN-state on the same row.

## Verdict

**common** — people are the source and people read the data back; where the human contribution *is* the irreplaceable value (content, judgement, curation), this is the natural product and its demand is real wherever this audience exists. It is a costlier build — human input is the softest and most expensive channel — which is exactly why it is built only where a person's contribution is the point.
