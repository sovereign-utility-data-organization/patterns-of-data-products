# 8.12 — omni-channel + human → stream + human

**Interface:** IN {B, R, S, H} → OUT {S, H}&emsp;&emsp;**Verdict:** common

A product that takes files (batch), on-demand APIs, live streams, and human-produced data and serves a live feed and a human-facing surface (dashboard/report). People both produce and read the data: the human pattern is on both sides.

## When to use

A small group of people both maintains and reads the data, with no machine consumer — a shared, human-scale record rather than an automated interface.

## What's inside

- Ingest: a scheduled **bulk ingest** (pickup, parse, validate, load), a **poller/connector** over the upstream API (version anchor, pagination, retry), a **stream consumer** (offsets, replay) for the live leg, and **human entry / curation** — data produced by people (forms, editors, review UIs), validated and audit-trailed on every change.
- Core: a **transform** (filter/shape/route) over the live leg and a **merge layer** that unifies human-entered data with the machine legs into one canonical view
- Serve: a **producer** re-exposing the (transformed) live feed and a **human-facing surface** (dashboard, report, printout, or review screen) — the layer people actually read.
- State: a durable **state store**, the **feed log** (retention), and an **audit trail** of human changes.

## State & cost

Dominated by the durable state store (grows with entity/state breadth), the input and output feed logs, and the audit trail of human edits.

## Watch out

- **Softness is a cost, not a value judgement.** Human-entered data is the softest input — irregular, subjective, error-prone, expensive to re-issue — so it needs **validation, provenance, and a correction path**, and trust leans on the audit trail, not the schedule. It is also the most expensive channel: where a machine source *can* carry the same meaning, prefer it, and keep the human leg for what only a person can supply.
- **Human input can be the value-driver.** Where the human act *is* the value — a judgement, a design intent, creative or social content, an accountable decision — and cannot be automated, human input is the **most valuable input** the product has, and the other legs exist to *enrich* it (see [the role of human input](/knowledge-concepts/role-of-human-input)).
- A human-facing surface inherits the state behind it: the report/dashboard carries every as-of and correctness rule of the store, and a person spots a stale number faster than an API client will.
- **Mixed time bases** in the inputs (live vs. poll/cycle/human): fix the authoritative as-of per surface, or each output looks correct alone and wrong cross-checked.

## Typical next step

add a **query API** → cell [8.11](/data-product-types/in-brsh-out-rsh) and add a **bulk file** → cell [8.10](/data-product-types/in-brsh-out-bhs); or the source world gains a leg this product does not yet take, and it migrates to a richer IN-state on the same row.

## Verdict

**common** — A product that ingests human input layered on top of bulk files, query APIs, and live feeds and serves live feeds plus a human-facing surface (a dashboard, report, or review). It is a natural fit where the human act *is* the value — a judgement, a decision, a curated record — so the softest, costliest channel is then the *cost of having that value*; where the act *could* be automated the cheaper machine path wins.
