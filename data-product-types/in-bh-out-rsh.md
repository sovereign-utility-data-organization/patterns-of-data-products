# 14.11 — file + human → API/stream + human

**Interface:** IN {B, H} → OUT {R, S, H}&emsp;&emsp;**Verdict:** common

A product that takes files (batch) and human-produced data and serves a query API, a live feed, and a human-facing surface (dashboard/report). People both produce and read the data: the human pattern is on both sides.

## When to use

A small group of people both maintains and reads the data, with no machine consumer — a shared, human-scale record rather than an automated interface.

## What's inside

- Ingest: a scheduled **bulk ingest** (pickup, parse, validate, load) and **human entry / curation** — data produced by people (forms, editors, review UIs), validated and audit-trailed on every change.
- Core: a **stream core** that turns each change into an event — **trigger-based**, where each human action delivered through this product's own surface (form submission, approval, entry) is itself a discrete event, or **observed-state**, where a **change-detection engine** manufactures the events by diffing the non-streaming inputs on a refresh cadence — plus a **merge layer** that unifies the human-entered data with the machine legs into one canonical view
- Serve: a **query service** (the API surface) over the state store, a **producer** that emits the event feed to subscribers, and a **human-facing surface** (dashboard, report, printout, or review screen) — the layer people actually read.
- State: a durable **state store**, the **event log** (retention), an **audit trail** of human changes, and — in the observed-state shape — a **diff baseline**.

## State & cost

Dominated by the durable state store (grows with entity/state breadth), the event log, and the audit trail of human edits (plus a diff baseline in the observed-state shape).

## Watch out

- **Softness is a cost, not a value judgement.** Human-entered data is the softest input — irregular, subjective, error-prone, expensive to re-issue — so it needs **validation, provenance, and a correction path**, and trust leans on the audit trail, not the schedule. It is also the most expensive channel: where a machine source *can* carry the same meaning, prefer it, and keep the human leg for what only a person can supply.
- **Human input can be the value-driver.** Where the human act *is* the value — a judgement, a design intent, creative or social content, an accountable decision — and cannot be automated, human input is the **most valuable input** the product has, and the other legs exist to *enrich* it (see [the role of human input](/knowledge-concepts/role-of-human-input)).
- A human-facing surface inherits the state behind it: the report/dashboard carries every as-of and correctness rule of the store, and a person spots a stale number faster than an API client will.
- **Where the feed is synthetic, and where it is not:** when human actions are delivered through this product's own surface (a submission, an approval, an entry), each action is a discrete, real event and the feed is *not* synthetic. When changes arrive as *modified state* (edited elsewhere, found by refresh), the feed is a **synthetic stream** — "change" is a computed diff bounded by the refresh cadence — and the contract must pin what counts as a change, idempotency, and backfill (see [synthetic stream](/knowledge-concepts/synthetic-stream)).

## The stream: trigger-based or synthetic

This cell serves **S** without taking **S** as input, and it hosts two shapes — only one of which is synthetic:

- **Trigger-based** — a real event stream: the human action itself (a submission, an approval, an entry through this product's own surface) is the discrete event, with its occurrence time. S is absent from the IN side because a person produced the data, not because the events are being manufactured.
- **Observed-state** — a **synthetic stream**: changes in a shared register, sheet, or document reach this product only as modified state, and the events are manufactured by diffing on a refresh cadence (event time = observation time).

In the observed-state shape the contract must pin down the five items (see [synthetic stream](/knowledge-concepts/synthetic-stream)):

1. **What counts as a "change"** — field-level, row version, or full snapshot?
2. **Latency bound** — bounded by the refresh cadence, not source event time.
3. **Idempotency** — re-polling / re-loading must not duplicate events.
4. **Backfill semantics** — how history is (re)issued after a gap or correction.
5. **Ordering** — whether the stream preserves source ordering at all.

## Typical next step

add a **bulk file** → cell [14.8](/data-product-types/in-bh-out-brsh); or the source world gains a leg this product does not yet take, and it migrates to a richer IN-state on the same row.

## Verdict

**common** — people are the source and people read the data back; where the human contribution *is* the irreplaceable value (content, judgement, curation), this is the natural product and its demand is real wherever this audience exists. It is a costlier build — human input is the softest and most expensive channel — which is exactly why it is built only where a person's contribution is the point.
