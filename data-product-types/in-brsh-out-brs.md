# 8.1 — omni-channel + human → omni-channel

**Interface:** IN {B, R, S, H} → OUT {B, R, S}&emsp;&emsp;**Verdict:** plausible

A product that takes files (batch), on-demand APIs, live streams, and human-produced data and serves bulk files, a query API, and a live feed. Human-entered data is one leg of the source, alongside files, upstream APIs, and live streams; the product carries that mix through to bulk files, a query API, and a live feed.

## When to use

The data is partly human-curated, alongside files, upstream APIs, and live streams, and the audience needs it as bulk files, a query API, and a live feed — the product is the layer between a person's editing and the consumer.

## What's inside

- Ingest: a scheduled **bulk ingest** (pickup, parse, validate, load), a **poller/connector** over the upstream API (version anchor, pagination, retry), a **stream consumer** (offsets, replay) for the live leg, and **human entry / curation** — data produced by people (forms, editors, review UIs), validated and audit-trailed on every change.
- Core: a **fold/aggregation core** that folds the live leg into queryable state or windowed files and a **merge layer** that unifies human-entered data with the machine legs into one canonical view
- Serve: a **publication job** that materialises bulk artifacts (files/bundles) with a manifest and as-of, a **query service** (the API surface) over the state store, and a **producer** re-exposing the (transformed) live feed.
- State: a durable **state store**, the **feed log** (retention), the **retained bulk artifacts**, and an **audit trail** of human changes.

## State & cost

Dominated by the durable state store (grows with entity/state breadth), the input and output feed logs, the retained bulk artifacts, and the audit trail of human edits.

## Watch out

- **Softness is a cost, not a value judgement.** Human-entered data is the softest input — irregular, subjective, error-prone, expensive to re-issue — so it needs **validation, provenance, and a correction path**, and trust leans on the audit trail, not the schedule. It is also the most expensive channel: where a machine source *can* carry the same meaning, prefer it, and keep the human leg for what only a person can supply.
- **Human input can be the value-driver.** Where the human act *is* the value — a judgement, a design intent, creative or social content, an accountable decision — and cannot be automated, human input is the **most valuable input** the product has, and the other legs exist to *enrich* it (see [the role of human input](/concepts/role-of-human-input)).
- **Mixed time bases** in the inputs (live vs. poll/cycle/human): fix the authoritative as-of per surface, or each output looks correct alone and wrong cross-checked.
- Late and out-of-order events are a **first-class** question: a watermark and a re-issue/correction rule, or history gains holes and duplicate facts.
- A published file is a **completeness claim**: a manifest-first publish and a supersession rule belong in the contract.

## Typical next step

add a **human-facing surface** → cell [8.8](/data-product-types/in-brsh-out-brsh); or the source world gains a leg this product does not yet take, and it migrates to a richer IN-state on the same row.

## Verdict

**plausible** — A product that ingests human input layered on top of bulk files, query APIs, and live feeds and serves bulk files, query APIs, and live feeds. It is a deliberate, project-shaped choice — not a default pipe — because human input is the softest and costliest channel, so where the value *could* be automated the machine path is preferred; where the human act *is* the irreplaceable value it is the most valuable input the product has and the machine legs exist to *enrich* it.
