# 12.14 — stream + human → file + human

**Interface:** IN {S, H} → OUT {B, H}&emsp;&emsp;**Verdict:** common

A product that takes live streams and human-produced data and serves bulk files and a human-facing surface (dashboard/report). People both produce and read the data: the human pattern is on both sides.

## When to use

A small group of people both maintains and reads the data, with no machine consumer — a shared, human-scale record rather than an automated interface.

## What's inside

- Ingest: a **stream consumer** (offsets, replay) for the live leg and **human entry / curation** — data produced by people (forms, editors, review UIs), validated and audit-trailed on every change.
- Core: a **fold/aggregation core** that folds the live leg into queryable state or windowed files
- Serve: a **publication job** that materialises bulk artifacts (files/bundles) with a manifest and as-of and a **human-facing surface** (dashboard, report, printout, or review screen) — the layer people actually read.
- State: a durable **state store**, the **feed log** (retention), the **retained bulk artifacts**, and an **audit trail** of human changes.

## State & cost

Dominated by the durable state store (grows with entity/state breadth), the retained bulk artifacts, and the audit trail of human edits.

## Watch out

- Human-entered data is the softest input: it arrives irregularly, carries intent and errors, and needs **validation, provenance, and a correction path** — trust leans on the audit trail, not the schedule.
- A human-facing surface inherits the state behind it: the report/dashboard carries every as-of and correctness rule of the store, and a person spots a stale number faster than an API client will.
- Late and out-of-order events are a **first-class** question: a watermark and a re-issue/correction rule, or history gains holes and duplicate facts.

## Typical next step

add a **query API** → cell [12.9](/data-product-types/in-sh-out-bhr) and add a **feed** → cell [12.10](/data-product-types/in-sh-out-bhs); or the source world gains a leg this product does not yet take, and it migrates to a richer IN-state on the same row.

## Verdict

**common** — people both feed and read the data, so it is a natural product, and its demand is real where this audience exists.
